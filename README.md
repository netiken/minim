# Minim

Minim is a custom single-link simulator built for the Parsimon project. Given a
bottleneck link configuration, congestion control parameters (only DCTCP is
currently supported), a list of sources, and a list of flows, Minim will output
a list of flow completion time records.

Once [Rust is installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), run
`cargo doc --open` for details.
